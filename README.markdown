# math-functions: efficient, special purpose mathematical functions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Shimuuar/math-functions.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Shimuuar/math-functions)

This package provides a number of special-purpose mathematical
functions used in statistical and numerical computing.

Where possible, we give citations and computational complexity
estimates for the algorithms used.
